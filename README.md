# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
Links to all my completed and in-progress projects, as well as some information about my favorite tools and pieces of my workflow.
## Complete Projects
### [MonkeyType Analysis](https://github.com/jackcooperusesvim/monkeytype-analysis)
#### Tools Used
  - Python (Libraries and tools)
  - Sk-Learn
  -  Pandas
  -  Jupyter Notebooks
#### Skills on Display
  - Data Visualization
  - Data Analysis
  - Data Transformation
#### Other Notes and the Personal Side
  I started this project before I started using AI as a part of my workflow. Since this project I have been pretty consistently using super-maven AI autocomplete for about half of the time I work on my projects (e.g. a morning off, afternoon on, etc). This project was also my first-time experience of using Jupyter Notebooks for Data Analysis. While I was definitely impressed, I still don't think it can replace neovim+tmux for me. Excellent tool for those who haven't settled yet though.

### [Music_Analysis](https://github.com/jackcooperusesvim/Music_Analysis)
#### Tools Used
  - Pandas and Polars
  - Basic SQL
  - Sk-Learn
#### Skills on Display
  - Data Visualization
  - Data Modeling and the Data Analysis Process
  - Data Transformation
  - Data Modeling an
#### Other Notes
  It was during the course of this analysis (or more accurately, it was during the data prep), that I found the Polars library and discovered the idea of embedded SQL in Python DataFrame Libraries. Personally, I hate the syntax of Pandas, so the fact that I could do aggregations and filtering with old-faithful SQL was a game-changer. I am still dedicating time to learning Pandas and Polars syntax, as they are (in order) the current and future industry standard, and many data operations still require it, but embedded SQL is such a blazingly fast improvement for anyone, that I can't ignore it. It is now definitively a part of my workflow.
  
## In-Progress Projects

### [Music_Analysis (continuation)](https://github.com/jackcooperusesvim/Music_Analysis)
#### Goal
  I would like to expand on this analysis more, and develop a model for predicting the popularity of a song based off of it's intrinsic musical features

### _TODO: FUN MUSIC-RELATED DATA PROJECT TO COME HERE (I need to get it to a presentable state first...)_

### Go_Learn | Data Science Library
#### Goal
  The goal for this project is to learn more about the core algoritms behing statistical and Machine Learning models by writing them from scratch in Go with nothing but the standard library. I don't care _too_ much about speed or optimization, but more on writing the algorithms as they might be expressed in speech. This is not intended to be practical: it's a learning experience.
#### Status
  This project is not all on GitHub (yet), but I do have some of it contained in the ["golang" branch of my Music_Analysis project](https://github.com/jackcooperusesvim/Music_Analysis/tree/golang)
  
## The Backburner

### [Connect 4 AI (minimax)](https://github.com/jackcooperusesvim/connect4)
#### Goal
  The goal for this project is to build an AI algorithm (minimax) to play connect 4 perfectly (like some do in tic-tac-toe). Written in Go
#### Status
  I am going to be honest, I tried to calculate if my computer could even hold all the information needed at once, and results were inconclusive. This may or may-not be an impossibility (lol), but I am going to give it a shot. So far I just have the encoding and decoding for a compressed connect 4 board finished.
  
## Favorite Tools

Currently Learning/Improving In (ordered by priority):
- Pandas, Keras, and Matplotlib
- Neovim _btw_ (This one is gonna be here a while. 2 years in and I am pretty fast, but there's no way I have even scratched the surface)
- Go (currently learning on boot.dev)
- Django (for living the solopreneur dream someday)
- Stenography (10 minutes a day, and you can learn anything)<br>

On the Backburner:
  - Backend Development with Go/Django (for living the solopreneur dream someday. Thanks to [boot.dev](boot.dev) btw for the great course)
  - Mojo for Data Analysis (still in beta, but looks promising)


Data Analysis:
  - Tableau (Generally not a fan of no/low-code tools, but Tableau is too effective to ignore)
  - Python
    - Polars (Blazingly fast + embedded SQL)
    - Seaborn (simple and effective)
    - Sk-Learn (Great for all med/shallow learning)
    - sqlite3 (simple and practical)
  - Mojo (still in beta, but looks promising)

General Computer Use:
  - Arc Browser
  - Amethyst Window Manager (must-have for Mac)
  - Catpuccin Theme (I use it for everything I can)
  - DROP Planck keyboard (Colemak btw)

Terminal and Code Editing:
  - Alacritty (Might switch to Ghostty when it releases)
  - Tmux
  - Neovim (btw)
    - harpoon2.nvim
    - telescope.nvim
    - oil.nvim
    - neotree
    - transparent.nvim
    - super-maven.nvim (Blazingly fast AI autocomplete | _FASTER THAN MY LSP!!!_)
  
AI:
  - Ollama (considering building a personal RAG with this)
  - super-maven (also in the "Terminal and Code Editing" section)
